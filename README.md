# QVault Hackathon Submission
My submission to QVault's Hackathon

## Setup:
First, git clone the repo into your IDE of choice:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/GitHubEmploy/qvaulthackathon.git
 ```
 
 Next, cd into the repo:
 ```shell
 cd qvaulthackathon
 ```
 
 From there, install deps are listed in requirements.txt, (for mac [intel])
 ```shell
 pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 ```
 
## Run CMD:
The actual run command can only be done when in the qvaulthackthon bas directory. Execute the following code in shell
```shell
python3 main.py
```

## What is this?

This is essentially a voice to note translator, in which I then play the preassigned note for that note range, hence making a song based off of your voice. The only issues I faced were a slight delay from anywhere from 3-7 seconds, with 4 seconds on avg. It uses a custom trained and built AI to acomplish this task.

Please DM me at ``blankuser#0001`` if you have any problems getting it working
